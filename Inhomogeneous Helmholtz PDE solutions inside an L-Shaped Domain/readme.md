This directory contains the Julia code i developed for solving an **Inhomogenous Helmholtz PDE** inside an **L-shaped domain**. 

The problem is going to be solved with various of advanced numerical methods including the Conjugate Gradient Method, Generalized Minimal Residual Method, Domain Decomposition (with SAP as a preconditioner to CG) and Multigrid.
